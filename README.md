The user specifies the password length.
If the length is less than 4, it prompts the user to enter a valid number.
2.Password Generation:
Uses a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special symbols.
Ensures the password contains at least one of each type of character.
Randomly fills the remaining characters.
3.Randomization for Security:
Uses random.sample() to shuffle the characters for better randomness.
